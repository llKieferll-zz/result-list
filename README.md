# About
A coding challenge that should be done in a few hours.
The goal was not to finish it perfectly, but to give a grasp of the coding style and how things are done. 

Get the files on your pc and, when inside that folder, use the following commands:

```yarn```

```yarn start```

The first command, "yarn", will install everything needed. After that, "yarn start" will start everything up and then open your browser to show the results.

Make sure you have both [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable) and [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed before everything.

# Considerations

- Decided to use [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) for comfort.

- Intended to use [mat-grid-list](https://material.angular.io/) to organize the position of elements inside each result-item after everything was already working fine but was already past the 3 hours limit so I left it as it was.

- Initially intended to use [BreakpointObserver](https://material.angular.io/cdk/layout/overview) as base for the responsivity but decided to use CSS grid instead.

- On chrome's developer tools, the iPhone X is too high, which means it behaves as a tablet on landscape.

- The filter lacks style but just like the grid list, I didn't want to go too far past the 3 hours limit.

In the end, it was very fun to reconnect with Angular after some weeks :)
